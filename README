LoremIpsum Generator jQuery and Native JS

You can generate Lorem Ipsum texts and images with JavaScript. Without copying from anywhere.

You just add the code

$('[data-lorem]').lorem();

and run your website on development.

If you want to put a lorem text inside a DIV (etc.) tag just write:

<div data-lorem="2p"></div>

Lorem.js has a simple query language: "how many?, what?"

2p = 2 paragraphs
5s = 5 sentences
6w = 6 words

That's it.

And Lorem.js uses lorempixum.com for images for now. You just write

<img src="" data-lorem="sports/1/Test message" width="223" height="223">
<img src="" data-lorem="gray" width="100" height="124">
<img src="" data-lorem="gray animals" width="100" height="124">

And watch what happens :)
